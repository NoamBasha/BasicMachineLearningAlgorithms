# BasicMachineLearningAlgorithms

## K-Means

To use the algorithm you are required to insert (1) an image path (2) the number of colors you want it to be drawn with - as inputs to the program.

## K-Nearest-Neighbours

To use the algorithm you are required to insert (1) train_x path (2) train_y path (3) test_x path (4) output file name (5) the number of neighbours - as inputs to the program.

## Perceptron, SVM, PA

To use the algorithm you are required to insert (1) train_x path (2) train_y path (3) test_x path (4) output file name - as inputs to the program.
